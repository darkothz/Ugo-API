# Ugo-API

This website is mostly a model that I'm using for my future school projects, which has a variety of subjects I've studied during programming classes, based after 
my classmate Ugo, a very handsome man who is my biggest inspiration.
"Wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are", they say. Whoever said this didn't know Ugo like I do.
